# PythonChallengePbank-and-PyPoll
Coding assignment for the Week 3 Coding challenge
I have the two files in the repository, PyPoll and PyBank. Each contains the  code and text file.
This assignment has been submitted afer the deadline, but an extension was given by the SSM (Rachel Venn for the Bootcamp in Melbourne).
The PyBank code is simpler and more coherent structure, and relies on loops counting through the rows of data.
PyPoll is more complex, and the code could be prettier and more efficient. This relies on dictionaries, and, after much research and disappearing down rabbit holes, had to resort to setting up a variable to hold the report so that I could print it out in the required format.
